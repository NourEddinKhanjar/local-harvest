    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed"><%= siteTitle %> is a simple platform designed to bridge the gap between local producers (farmers, artisans, handmakers) and buyers within their communities, especially in contexts where internet access might be limited or expensive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 leading-relaxed"><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <li>To empower local producers by providing a free and easy way to showcase their products.</li>
        <li>To create job opportunities and support local economies.</li>
        <li>To make it simple for buyers to find and purchase locally sourced goods.</li>
        <li>To foster direct communication, building trust and community connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">We believe in the power of local. By connecting producers and buyers directly, we hope to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient local food and goods system.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This platform is intentionally kept minimal to ensure accessibility on basic smartphones and low-bandwidth connections. The focus is on facilitating the initial connection; the rest is up to the buyer and seller.</p>
